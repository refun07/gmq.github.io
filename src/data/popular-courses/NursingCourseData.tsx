                <br />
                
                <p>High demands for qualified nurses and related healthcare services, as reflected in Skilled Occupations List, is one of the driving factors for its popularity. Relevant educational background, work experiences maybe counted towards application of Permanent Residency.</p>
                
                <br />
                
                <p>Another appealing reason for practicing nurses to consider Global is the Bridging Program for Nurses or popularly known as IRON (Initial Registration for Overseas Nurses). Overseas nurses coming from different backgrounds and practice are prepared thoroughly to be integrated into the Globaln workforce.&nbsp; It strengthens their existing knowledge and skills; orient them to best practise methods in their field; and make them aware of their conduct and legal responsibilities in the practise of their profession in Global.</p>
                
                <br />
                
                <p>Also as the third most preferred destination for international students, the country continues to attract international students and tourists alike because of the culture, the sceneries, the laid back atmosphere and the unique flora and fauna and the thousand and one reasons why Global is the place to be.</p>
                
                <br />

    The need for qualified nurses in Australia's healthcare industry is expected to increase by 19% by 2026 due to an aging population and an increase in chronic diseases in Australia. Therefore, after the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been an increased need for medical professionals, which has forced the government to increase funding for healthcare. Qualified nurses are in high demand in the public and private sectors of the nursing profession because hospitals, nursing homes, and clinics need them.
