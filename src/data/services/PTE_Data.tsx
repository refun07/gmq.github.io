      <p class="part">Beginning a path towards a prosperous future frequently drives students to seek chances overseas, particularly in a global context. PTE clearance is a critical milestone for people considering a future in Australia, particularly for educational or settlement purposes. The Pearson Test of English (PTE) measures English ability in four areas: reading, listening, writing, and speaking. While IELTS was formerly the major evaluation medium, the Department of Immigration and Border Protection (DIBP) now recognises the importance of PTE, making it a critical test for those seeking to establish themselves on a global scale.</p>
      <p class="part">The Australian government recognises PTE as an unbiased, computer-based test across all visa categories. A minimum PTE score of 42 is required for overseas students seeking an Australian student visa.</p>
